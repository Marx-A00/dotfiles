;;; major-pane.el --- Toggle agent-shell side panel -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Cmd+i to toggle agent-shell as a left side panel.
;; C-u Cmd+i to toggle full-frame mode with layout restore.
;; When no agent-shell buffer exists, shows a launcher menu.
;; Includes a buffer picker (consult or hydra+posframe) for choosing
;; among multiple agent-shell conversations, with per-action config.
;;
;; IMPORTANT — agent-shell-display-action:
;;   agent-shell defers buffer display when session-strategy is 'prompt.
;;   The async callback uses `agent-shell-display-action' to decide where
;;   to show the buffer.  The default (display-buffer-same-window) will
;;   hijack the current window.  Set it to match major-pane's layout:
;;
;;     (setq agent-shell-display-action
;;           '((display-buffer-in-direction)
;;             (direction . left)
;;             (window-width . 0.30)))
;;
;;   This belongs in your USER CONFIG (e.g. emacs.org), not in this file.
;;   See README.md for details.
